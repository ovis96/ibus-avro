After a long time, we have tried to do something for the Avro (Linux). Now the Ubuntu-16.04 LTS has been released and we really need an easy installation way for this. No more waiting, the multi-arch supported .deb package has just arrived.

Installation

Please run these commands from the terminal. Never forget to be in relevant directory.

wget "https://github.com/maateen/avro/releases/download/v2.0/avro_2.0-1_all.deb"
sudo dpkg -i avro_2.0-1_all.deb
If you get any dependency error, then also run the following command:

sudo apt-get install -f
I hope, all is well now and the installation has been finished.

Go to System Settings -> Language Support from Unity Launcher

Look at the Keyboard input method system

Select IBus and close the window.

I believe that you need to restart IBus to make everything work fine. Try the following command:

ibus restart
Now go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Text Entry.

Search and add Avro Phonetic as input source. That's all.

If you find a bug, never forget to make us know here: https://github.com/maateen/avro/issues
